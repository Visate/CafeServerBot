## Maid Kotori

This bot was designed to work with only one server for the most part.
It will probably not work amazingly well on multiple servers without tweaks to the cogs and bot logic.
Please keep this in mind when using this bot!

## Using the bot
1. Make sure you have at least Python 3.5 installed on your computer!

2. Set up virtualenv

Just use `python3 -m venv venv` and make sure to activate it with `source venv/bin/activate` or look up your respective instructions for your OS on Google.

3. Install dependencies

`pip install -U -r requirements.txt`

Because I am on the rewrite branch of discord.py, this is in heavy BETA so there are things that could break at any time. Please keep this in mind.

4. Make sure to fill out config.py with the required information.

5. Launch with `python3 main.py` or `python3 bot.py` (bot.py just calls main.py)
